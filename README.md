Caleb McDaniel's Website 
========================

This repository contains the plain text files I used to generate [my
website](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu). As explained on my
[Colophon](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/colophon.html), I used a simple bash
shell script to run these files through pandoc and generate the files I
upload to my server.

The shell script is in this repository as `pansite.sh`.

The pandoc template used by the script (`website.html`) is located in my
[pandoc-template](https://github.com/wcaleb/pandoc-templates)
repository.
