Stephanie McCurry has noted that "the literature on the Confederacy has
long been characterized---and limited---by a preoccupation with the
matter of military defeat and related questions about the strength or
weakness of Confederate nationalism." Nowhere has this long
preoccupation been clearer than in the literature on Confederate state
governments. States appear in this literature most often in discussions
of their inability to supply homefront and military needs, or of the
dysfunctional relations between states jealous of their rights and a
grasping Richmond government. Historians discuss why Confederate states
divided and died far more than what they actually did.[^1]

One result has also been a preocupation with the question of what made
Southern states *different*, both from the Northern states that defeated
them and from the modern state more generally. A common answer to that
question, both among scholars and the general public, has been that
Confederate states were hampered by the limited-government,
laissez-faire views of their architects. They represented a paradox:
states built by anti-statists. In recent years, however, numerous
historians have brought "the state" back in to the study of the
Confederacy, and in the process have moved away from preoccupations with
"why the South lost" and "what made the South different." Their work
challenges the ideas that Southern states were weak, ineffective, and
committed on principle to limited intervention in society and the
economy.

Chad Morgan and John Majewski, for example, have shown that Confederates
in Georgia, Virginia, and South Carolina were not anti-modern
laissez-faire agrarians. They believed in strong "state activism,"
Majewski's term for the muscular use of public investment, legislation,
institutions, and even protective tariffs to develop the region's slave
economy. Secessionists drew on a long tradition of what Milton Sydney
Heath, a forerunner of this new literature, called "constructive
liberalism"---the belief that individual enterprise should be encouraged
by robust collective action. From this point of view, the strong central
state that Confederates ultimately built was not a paradox or turnabout,
but a culmination of antebellum trends.[^2]

What we might call the rediscovery of Confederate statism enables us to
see what made the Confederate state(s) similar to other states. Though
increasingly distinctive, from a hemispheric perspective, in their
attempts to use state action in the service of slavery, Confederates'
embrace of state activism to support manufacturing and internal
improvements placed them within a broad mainstream of nineteenth-century
state-building projects.

Indeed, as Ryan Quintana has recently argued in an article on internal
improvements in early national South Carolina, Southern states partially
exemplified the broader rise of what he calls "liberal governmentality."
Slave states not only invested in infrastructural improvements; they
also developed bureaucratic systems to oversee these projects, founded
public reformatory institutions (like schools, penitentiaries, and
asylums), and, in James Scott's influential formulation, created modern
tools for "seeing like a state": maps, surveys, censuses, administrative
boilerplate, and the like. In Quintana's words, Southern states were
"ardently committed to the project of modern state governance," not
despite but because of their commitments to slavery.[^3] In a similar
attempt to make Confederate politics less exceptional, Greg Downs has
also argued that the rise of a new postbellum conception of the national
state, which he calls "patronalism," also had its roots in Confederate
state policies and politics during the war.[^4]

In short, much like recent historians of slavery who have argued that
the institution was essential to the rise of capitalism, historians of
Southern states are beginning to see them as part of a broader
nineteenth-century story of state development. So far, however, this
historiographical wave has crashed only on eastern shores, leaving
western Confederate states like Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana largely
untouched. This neglect is not surprising, given that "scant attention
has been paid to the Civil War and Reconstruction in the
Trans-Mississippi" by American historians generally, as Steven Hahn
recently noted. Yet for historians attempting to push "beyond failure"
in their studies of Confederate statecraft, this neglect of the West is
especially unfortunate. Today I will suggest that bringing the
Trans-Mississippi West into view can extend and consolidate new
scholarship on Confederate statecraft, while also opening new lines of
inquiry about the afterlives of Confederate state policies in the
Reconstruction era.

Consider, for example, the administration of Louisiana Governor [Henry W.
Allen](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Henry%20W.%20Allen), who was elected in
November 1863. Allen initiated ambitious state programs such as the
establishment of bureaucracies to encourage manufacturing, mining, and chemical
laboratories; the commissioning of a state-run geological survey; the erection
of state-owned cloth and rope factories; the expansion of penitentiary
production; appropriations for education; and the state purchase, export, and
sale of cotton, whose proceeds he used to purchase goods that were then sold at
state-owned stores or distributed to indigent citizens. Under Allen's watch,
the state of Louisiana even invested directly in an iron works located across
the border in Texas by purchasing a quarter of the company's stock. One
retrospective survey dubbed Allen's short-lived but popular programs "a 'New
Deal' in the Old South."[^5]

Allen's state activism sprung partly from military necessity, to be
sure. As Allen put it in an 1865 address, "the country is at war---the
whole State is an immense camp." Yet in the same address, Allen also
envisioned manufacturing, public welfare, and strategic state investment
as only the "beginning" of an effort to make the state "self-sustaining"
and "prosperous" even after the war. Allen's activities resembled those
of eastern state officials who presided over activist states.[^6]

Like his North Carolina counterpart Zebulon Vance, Allen also expertly
performed the new political style that Downs calls "patronalism." He
allowed citizens to see state provisions as expressions of his personal
obligations and power, thereby enlarging expectations about what the
state could and should do for citizens. While Allen's friend Sarah
Dorsey complained that "the people had a trust and reliance upon him
that was frequently ludicrous," his own rhetoric encouraged that
reliance by casting state officials as powerful friends making personal
promises. "I promised every lady in Louisiana a pair of cotton cards,"
he told the legislature, identifying the state's word with his. In
Dorsey's words, Allen came to be seen as "the veritable Pater
Respublicae" who had adopted the entire state "as a sort of family." The
citizenry in turn flooded his office with petitions asking for state
intervention, belying the idea that Confederates were constitutionally
averse to dependence on the state.[^7]

A similar story can be told about neighboring Texas. Despite white
Texans' fierce pride in their history as a breakway republic,
Confederates there also called for a more active state. One soldier even
wrote to Governor [Pendleton Murrah](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Pendleton%20Murrah) from camp to complain that Allen's
Louisiana was excelling Texas in its encouragement of manufactures:

> I would ask if the already small state of Louisiana, with her ports
> all closed to the world, ... and but the poorest portion of the state
> left to her, can do as much in so short a time, what might the large &
> mighty state of Texas, with her seven hundred miles of seacoast, the
> blockade of which has so often been successfully run since the war
> began, an outlet into the friendly "state" or "empire" of Mexico with
> which we can trade, an immense territory, ... I ask what she might not
> do? Why sir with a little energy on the part of her Governor, she
> could be teeming with manufactories of every kind and in every part of
> the state. ... Then will we appear as we really are, a great people, a
> great nation in ourselves.[^8]

This anonymous writer not only typified patronal politics; he also
spotlighted some of the unique advantages that white Texans enjoyed in
comparison to Confederates elsewhere. The absence of significant combat
in the state brought little disruption to the operations of its
slave-based cotton economy. Largely cut off from the remainder of the
Confederacy after Union armies captured the Mississippi River in 1863,
Texas and Confederate officials also enjoyed a wider latitude for action
than those closer to Richmond and the front lines. Finally, and most
significantly, proximity to Mexico made it easier for limited cotton
sales to continue across the border at Eagle Pass and Brownsville.[^9]

Some of the state's features also presented unique challenges to the
Confederate government, however, including what Murrah's correspondent
called its "immense territory." With at least a third of the state still
unorganized into counties, and white settlements threatened by attack
from Native American polities to the west, the state struggled to supply
its so-called Frontier Regiment while also protecting the interests of
planters in the southeast. Even in that more populated region,
infrastructural improvements remained far less developed than they were
in the older states along the Atlantic seaboard. South Carolina had a
Board of Public Works as early as 1819; the American state of Texas was
still a teenager when the war began. Most of the state's railroad tracks
were still "pathetic fragments going nowhere," according to one
historian, and its "mediocre network of unpaved roads" wasn't much
better.[^10]

Nevertheless, the soldier who wrote to Murrah need not have worried that
the governor would neglect state action to remedy these defects. In his
inaugural address in 1863, Murrah had already spoken of government as a
"science" and the state as "machinery" whose chief end was to secure the
people's "welfare physically, morally and mentally," including by the
"establishment of manufactories." And though Murrah admitted that
industry depended primarily on private enterprise, "limited and
prescribed, as the government is, in its power over the subject," he and
his predecessor Francis Lubbock, together with the legislature, acted
energetically to encourage such enterprise. They laid the foundations of
the "constructive liberalism" that had already existed for some time in
the east.[^11]

Examples of this work can be briefly summarized. First, of all the Confederate
states, the Texas legislature was among the friendliest to railroads and
corporations. The state allowed the roads to pay debts late in depreciated
currency. And though several states offered bounties to newly incorporated
manufacturing firms, Texas was among the most generous. A [November 1863
law](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Texas%20Incorporation%20Acts) granted 320
acres to corporations for every \$1,000 they invested into new machinery, and
in its next two sessions, the legislature granted incorporation to over two
dozen firms to produce textiles, lead, paper, and other manufacturered goods,
with capital limits ranging from the tens of thousands to millions of dollars.
Though many of these companies failed to produce much before the end of the
war, in the end, according to one scholarly account, "the state of Texas
rivaled North Carolina in its patronage of manufacturers." Part of that
patronage included the promise of state protection for corporations wishing to
sell cotton in Mexico in exchange for machinery like looms. The Texas
legislature also showed special interest in the introduction of machinery at
its state penitentiary in Huntsville, one of the few Confederate prisons that
survived the war unscathed. While a prisoner-operated cotton and woolen mill
had been installed at the prison in the 1850s to offset costs, in wartime the
penitentiary became a major center of cloth production for the Confederacy, as
well as "Texas's leading source of revenue."[^12]

As these state programs grew in scale and complexity, Texas also expanded
bureaucracies to monitor their activities. In 1862, the legislature created
a three-person state [Military
Board](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Texas%20Military%20Board), granting it broad
powers to create foundries and ordnance factories; fund public works such as
salines; use state bonds to purchase supplies; and purchase and sell cotton for
the state. Under Lubbock, the board also extended loans directly to private
enterprises in certain industries.  Reorganized in 1864, the Board continued to
support industries and engage in cotton trading.[^13]

Under Murrah, the responsibility of purchasing cotton also shifted briefly to
another bureau, the [Texas Loan
Agency](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Texas%20Loan%20Agency), under a so-called
"State Plan" in which agents employed by Austin would purchase cotton for bonds
backed by land warrants. The state would transport the cotton, which was
protected from impressment by the Confederate military's Trans-Mississippi
Department because it was publicly owned, to the Rio Grande, sell it across the
border, and then split proceeds between the state and the original vendor of
the bales. It proved wildly popular among cotton planters eager for state
action on their behalf, and launched a thousand wagons bound for Mexico, where
state agents struggled to keep up with requisitions for machinery and sales of
cotton.[^14]

The Military Board and the Loan Agency required the employment of
numerous functionaries. Each spawned new administrative records,
complete with instructions to agents about how to mark cotton bales,
whom to engage in trade along the border, how much machinery could be
purchased and for what ends, and when to report back to Austin about
sales. Contracts between the state and corporations for the import of
machinery likewise had to detail, through new formulaic templates, the
precise number of bales that a company could sell and the exact purposes
to which machinery would be put. Invariably, of course, the activities
of the state's agents outran the state's ability to keep track of them
all, creating frequent rumors of mismanagement and state funds
disappearing to Havana or beyond. But like the operations of early
national South Carolina's sometimes inefficient Board of Public Works,
Texas's Military Board and Loan Agency are still significant indications
of the state's "governing logic"---its belief that the public business
could be legibly organized and controlled.[^15]

The logic of "legibility," James Scott's term for the modern state's attempts
to see and understand its own social domain, worked in a circular way to
lengthen the state's tentacles and obligations. Bureaus were needed to watch
the bureaus; committees formed to check on the boards. By the end of the war,
the legislature had appointed (at the request of the governor) committees to
investigate and report on both the penitentiary and the Military Board. And
after the war, new Auditorial Boards were created to sort out and judge claims
made on the state, as well as a [Board of Public
Labor](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Board%20of%20Public%20Labor), modeled on the
Military Board, to manage convict work.[^16]

Yet such boards only reinforce the similarities between the statecraft
of Texas and Louisiana and that of their eastern counterparts. These
Trans-Mississippi states, though facing a different array of
opportunities and challenges, also proved themselves "ardently committed
to the project of modern state governance." They did so, moreover, with
relatively broad support from constituents. As Lubbock recalled in his
memoirs, the many "incorporated enterprises" encouraged by the state
"indicated clearly the trend of the public mind at that day."[^17]

Yet this leads me to a final question: so what? After all, these states
fell apart and failed, and both Murrah and Allen fled to Mexico at war's
end. Why does it matter that we begin to see Confederate states not just
as failed experiments, but as experiments in "state activism,"
"constructive liberalism," patronalism, and seeing like a modern state?

I'll conclude with three possible answers to that "so what" question.
First, seeing Confederate states in the ways described above undermines
their exceptionalism. If we bracket the knowledge that they would fail,
it is possible to see that Trans-Mississippi states confronted problems
of sovereignty and statecraft that were common in the mid-nineteenth
century world. Indeed, the challenge Texas faced in securing spatial
control over its "immense territory," while also regulating and
stimulating an embattled economy, resembled the challenges the national
government would face after 1865 in establishing its sovereignty in the
region. More generally, if the history of the nineteenth century United
States was a story of what Charles Bright and Michael Geyer call two
modes of sovereignty, one grounded in the "production of territory" and
the other driven by attempts to turn national space into "territories of
production" that could "mobilize national resources and project power,"
the national and state history of Texas---in particular---might be
narrated in the same way: as a struggle over the sovereign power both to
produce territory and to mobilize production. Put more simply, moving
beyond the paradigm of defeat helps historicize Confederate statecraft
and nationalism in ways that make them less strange, enabling us to ask
"where in the world was the Confederacy."[^18]

Second, undermining the idea of Confederate statecraft as out of step with the
rise of the modern state also helps to undermine the idea (also criticized by
historians of slave capitalism and "second slavery") that modernity and slavery
were incompatible. Although I have not directly discussed state policies
regarding slavery in the Trans-Mississippi West, make no mistake: Lubbock,
Murrah, Allen, and other advocates of an active state all took for granted that
slavery formed an essential part of their programs, just as state planners
elsewhere in the South did.  Lubbock, for example, viewed the influx of
[refugees](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Refugees%20to%20Texas) from other
Confederate states who brought enslaved people to Texas as a boon to the state
because it would provide more labor and capital. The Texas iron works in which
the state of Louisiana invested, like many such firms, rented enslaved labor.
And, when surveying the state's still dilapidated [public
roads](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Texas%20Roads) in 1864, the Marshall
*Republican* urged the legislature to pass laws increasing the number of
enslaved people required to work on the highways. "The negroes, as every one is
aware, do the most of the road working," argued the editor, "and there are more
negroes in the State now than were ever here before. We hope the press
throughout the State will call attention of the Legislature to this important
matter." Had the Confederacy not been defeated, there is no reason to think
that slavery would have quickly died away---not *only* because of its continued
profitability to individuals, but also because Confederates envisioned slavery
as essential to the activist states they created during the war.[^19]

Indeed, Confederate state activism in places like Texas may help
explain, finally, why systems that looked so much like slavery cropped
up so quickly in the postbellum South. In narratives of the nineteenth
century South, systems like convict leasing, highway gangs, and mass
incarceration are often cited as continuations of "slavery by another
name," driven by the continued racism and rapacity of the slaveholding
class. Yet harsh penitentiary regimes depended equally on the idea that
states should be in the penitentiary labor business in the first place.
That idea had roots as well in the "constructive liberalism" and state
manufacturing projects of secessionists and Confederates. Reconstruction
leasing systems also depended on penitentiary workshops and institutions
ready to receive freedpeople caught in the dragnets of postbellum Black
Codes, and so it matters that states like Texas and Louisiana managed to
defend and even expand such operations during the war.[^20]

In 1866, for instance, Texas passed one of the earliest laws allowing the
leasing of prisoners outside [the
penitentiary](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Huntsville%20State%20Penitentiary)
walls. The legislature did so partly to keep afloat one of its most reliable
revenue streams during the war: prison labor. And it leased its first prisoners
to two railroad companies that had already received aid from Confederate
legislation in the state. Five years later, when the state decided to lease the
entire prison to a private contractor, much like many states across the South
and North had long before, it also chose, as the first lessee, a man who had
arguably benefitted from the state's wartime state activism, having joined one
of the manufacturing companies incorporated after the November 1863 law and
then worked as a cotton factor in the trade that Murrah's State Plan helped to
prop up. Perhaps by looking closer at Confederate statecraft in the
Trans-Mississippi, and not only to explain why the Confederacy died, we can
find new ways to understand the origins of what lived on after it did.[^21]

    statecraft is sufficiently historicized, we might even be able to
    return with fresh eyes to the question of why the Confederate state
    failed without having to posit that it died of an exceptionally
    anti-modern worldview. For example, it may be, as McCurry and
    Majewski have implied for reasons detailed in their work, that the
    Confederacy died not of too little nationalism, but too much---not
    of being behind their times, but of being so much of them.
    Nationalizing states fell apart frequently, after all, in the
    nineteenth century world.

    2008). [A. J. Ward](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/A.%20J.%20Ward), a former
    superintendent of penitentiary labor in Arkansas, had fled to Texas in 1863
    after Union forces captured his prison. There, my initial research suggests
    that he built new business networks by joining one of the numerous
    manufacturing firms called into being by the legislature's liberal November
    1863 incorporation law: the Bastrop Manufacturing Company, which received
    assistance from Murrah's Military Board in its attempts to sell cotton in
    Mexico for machinery. By the end of the war, he had established himself as
    a cotton and wool factor in Galveston. Drawing on social and material
    capital amassed in his new home, Ward then pivoted into the state's first
    penitentiary lease, presiding over what by all accounts was one of the most
    brutal convict leasing regimes in the postwar South. See "An Act to
    Incorporate the Bastrop Cotton and Wool Manufacturing Company," *Weekly
    State Gazette* (August), November 16, 1864; P. R. Smith to Pendleton
    Murrah, August 7, 1864, from the Mexico Border in Records of the Military
    Board of Texas, Texas State Library and Archives.  For more on Ward's
    fascinating story, see Michael Pierce, “The Mechanics of Little Rock: Free
    Labor Ideas in Antebellum Arkansas, 1845-1861,” *Arkansas Historical
